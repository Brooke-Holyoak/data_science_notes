##What I've Learned So Far re: Git

Do the workflow many times a day!

Workflow:
1. git add
2. git commit
3. git push

extras: adding a period . after git add . will add everything in that folder, adding a asterisk * after git add * is a wildcard. so if you want to add all .sql files, you can git add *.sql to add.

ADDING A NEW REPO QUICKLY AND CLEANLY!

go to github.com/new
type in the new repo name
click on the green code button 
copy the ssh key
go to terminal
navigate to the folder you want the new repo folder to be in
git code <paste ssh key here>
navigate into the new folder
git add workflow!
voila! new repo!
